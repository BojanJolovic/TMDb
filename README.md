Top 10 Movies/TVShows

About app,

When app start viewDidLoad call function load data to take database for movie from server, then from category results take 4 element which they need to run the app (title, backdrop, poster and overview), and keeps it in array. When segmented control change to tv shows, doing the same thing, after reload data from array when changed. If u think that something needs to change, u can tell me. I think maybe is batter add core data in app, and just first time when start app, download results. For refresh data in core data can create button or pull down to refresh.

Best regards,
Bojan
